// Q 12
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.


// Solution
let greet : string[] = ['Eric', 'Bob', 'Ali']

console.log(greet[0], 'you invited in a dinner');
console.log(greet[1], 'you invited in a dinner');
console.log(greet[2], 'you invited in a dinner');
