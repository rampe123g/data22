// Q 42
// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.



// Solution 

let magicians = ["David Copperfield", "David Blaine", "Criss Angel"];

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void {
    for(let magician of magicians) {
        console.log(`Hello there`, magician);
    }
}

show_magicians(magicians);
