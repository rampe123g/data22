// Q 20
// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var something = ["mountains", "rivers", "countries", "cities", "languages"];
console.log(something[0]);
console.log(something[1]);
console.log(something[2]);
console.log(something[3]);
console.log(something[4]);
